## Features

*  *Beautiful* and *modern*
*  Does **not** force a font on you. I suggest a thin version of *Helvetica Neue* or any thin font in gernal. For example [Montserrat](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/montserrat) is a very nice choice, too.
*  Sender names on the *left*, time on the *right*. Nice and sleek
*  Multiple messages from the same user only display the username for the first message
*  Single letter messages are usually meant as corrections and are **added to the previous line**
*  *"Topic set"* occurances are deleted if the that topic has already been set
*  Hides your own *join* and *leave* messages
*  Nice animations
*  Beautiful highlights and inline images

## Installing

1. [Download](https://github.com/00SteinsGate00/Textual-Flat/archive/master.zip) the Theme
2. Open **Textual** and under `Preferences -> Addons -> Installed Addons` click on `Open in Finder` blow and open the *Styles* folder
3. Extract the theme folder there and rename it to your liking
4. Select the theme under `Preferences -> Style`

## Contributing

This is still a work in progress. It supports all the features I need so far, but there could be things missing. If you happen to notice that, I kindly ask to you open an issue about it.
